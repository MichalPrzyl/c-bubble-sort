# Bubble Sort written in C

## Why
I think C algorithms are crucial to understand how programming should be done so I am 
trying to understand for example how sorting works.

## What I've learned
Its' only bubble sort algorithm but I learned a lot about pointers, memory adressing
and how pointers are so connected to arrays.

## Flaws
I understand that I can initialize array as pointer to first element (in the first place) but those small things
I want to leave the way they are because I hope to dive into this repo in future so basically
"the more scope my code covers, the more I will remember and will be able to remind someday" :)
Hope that makes sense.
